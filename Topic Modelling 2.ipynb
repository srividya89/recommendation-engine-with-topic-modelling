    "What is Topic Modeling?\n",
    "Topic modeling is a method for identifying latent motifs or subjects in vast amounts of text data. It entails analyzing the words in the documents to find patterns and grouping similar documents based on their substance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is extensively used in many fields, including banking, healthcare, marketing, and social media analysis. Topic modeling can find important topics and patterns that take time to become evident to people by analyzing and grouping words in a text corpus.\n",
